This is a project for the Traveling salesman problem (tsp).

Here is a brief introduction to the process.
1.  Apply the Christofides algorithm.
2.  Apply the Randomswap algorithm, 2-opt, 3-opt, and chromosome algorithm to find a better solution.
3.  Apply the Genetic algorithm, and Simulated Annealing algorithm to find a better solution.

Inspired by "The Traveling Salesman Problem: When Good Enough Beats Perfect" from Youtube (online).
